You can download files, read documentation, and submit bug reports at wic's [github repository](https://github.com/wolearyc/wic). \r\n\r\nWic was built with the following design goals in mind:\r\n* simplicity\r\n* extendability\r\n* effective and robust error reporting\r\n* effective documentation\r\n* library-wide consistency\r\n* flexibility in memory management\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\nDirectories and Files\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n* license.md -- License. \r\n* readme.md -- Readme. \r\n* Makefile -- Makefile. \r\n* deps/ -- Dependency files.\r\n    * lib/ -- Dependency libraries.\r\n\t* include/ -- Dependency header files.\r\n* doc/ -- Doxygen documentation.\r\n* include/ -- Header files.\r\n* lib/ -- Dependency libraries.\r\n* src/ -- Source files.\r\n* bin/ -- Libraries [created on build].\r\n    * debug/ -- Debug library (debug/libwic.a) [created on build].\r\n    * release/ -- Release library (release/libwic.a) [created on build].\r\n* obj/ -- Object files [created on build].\r\n    * debug/ -- Debug objects [created on build].\r\n    * release/ -- Release objects [created on build].\r\n\t\r\nBuilding wic\r\n-------------\r\nWic uses the standard \"make\" to build. No configure script is included, mostly because the makefile is so small and easy to modify. It should build on any system with gcc, make, and binutils installed. \r\nFrom wic's root directory, the following make commands can be executed:\r\n\r\n* $ make -- Builds wic as a static library.\r\n* $ make all -- Functions identically to \"$ make\".\r\n* $ make release -- Functions identically to \"$ make\".\r\n* $ make debug -- Builds wic as a static library with debug symbols.\r\n* $ make doxygen -- Generates wic's doxygen documentation.\r\n* $ make clean -- Removes all library and object files.\r\n\r\nUsing wic in your project\r\n--------------------------\r\nFirst, you'll need to include wic's header files.\r\n\r\n1. Copy include/ and deps/ into your project.\r\n2. In your project, delete deps/lib to save space. You won't be needing it.\r\n3. Add include/ and deps/include as include paths. In gcc, this can be done with \"-I include/ -I deps/include\", assuming include/ and deps/ are in your working directory.\r\n\r\nSecond, you'll need to link in the appropriate libraries and frameworks.\r\n\r\n1. From wic's root directory, run $make.\r\n2. Copy libwic.a from lib/release/ into your project. \r\n3. Link libwic.a to your project. In gcc, this is done with \"-lwic\" assuming that libwic.a is in your working directory.\r\n4. You'll also need to link in the Cocoa, Quartz, IOKit, and OpenGL frameworks. In gcc, this can be done with \"-framework Cocoa -framework Quartz -framework IOKit -framework OpenGL\".\r\n\r\nLastly, you'll need to include \"wic_lib.h\" in all the code you write. Then you should be good to go!\r\n\r\nLicensing and Distribution\r\n--------------------------\r\nWic is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 3. You must include license.md in all projects which use the entirety or sections of wic.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\nPortions of this software are copyright © 2013 The FreeType Project.
