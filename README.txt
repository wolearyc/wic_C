====

The Wick Game Engine library written for C++. Wick comes in a variety of flavors:

DEVELOPED
1. WickEngine_DirectX
   Wick Engine compatible with Microsoft Windows and build on DirectX.
   Essentially complete, but will eventually be replaced by WickEngine.
   IF YOU'RE FROM MIT, THIS IS FOR YOU :)

FUTURE
1. WickEngine
   Identical to WickEngine_DirectX, just built on OpenGL and compatible with Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.
   Will have improvements across the board + tons of new features appealing to more advanced developers. 

2. uWick (micro-Wick)
   Contains system dependent functions of WickEngine (aka input, windows, errors).
   Will allow flexible use of advanced OpenGL features while keeping program cross-platform.
